# SquidGame-Glass-Bridge
This is a console game based on one of the challenges in the series "Squid Game". The player has to choose a tile to jump, if the tile is strong and can withstand, the player moves on, otherwise the tile breaks and player dies. The player's task is to reach the end. In game options you can adjust the number of tiles, tiles in one group and the number of fragile tiles. 
On this console game, I learned code refactoring, OOP and working with git.
